This bibliography is a resource for people writing papers that refer
to the Google cluster traces.  It covers papers that analyze the
traces, as well as ones that use them as inputs to other studies.

  * I recommend using \usepackage{url}.
  * Entries are in publication-date order, with the most recent at the top.
  * Bibtex ignores stuff that is outside the entries, so text like this is safe.

The following are the RECOMMENDED CITATIONS if you just need the basics:

  * Borg:
     * \cite{clusterdata:Verma2015, clusterdata:Tirmazi2020} for Borg itself
  * 2019 traces:
     * \cite{clusterdata:Wilkes2020, clusterdata:Wilkes2020a, clusterdata:Tirmazi2020} for
       the complete set of info about trace itself.

	Google's Borg system is a cluster manager that runs hundreds of thousands of jobs,
	from many thousands of different applications, across a number of clusters each with
	up to tens of thousands of machines.

	It achieves high utilization by combining admission control, efficient task-packing,
	over-commitment, and machine sharing with process-level performance isolation.
	It supports high-availability applications with runtime features that minimize
	fault-recovery time, and scheduling policies that reduce the probability of correlated
	failures. Borg simplifies life for its users by offering a declarative job specification
	language, name service integration, real-time job monitoring, and tools to analyze and
	simulate system behavior.

	We present a summary of the Borg system architecture and features, important design
	decisions, a quantitative analysis of some of its policy decisions, and a qualitative
	examination of lessons learned from a decade of operational experience with it.},

   12.5k nodes in the analysed GCD cluster. Task constraint operators are compacted, pre-processed with one-hot

	constrained as to the kind of machine types they can use, increasing the
	complexity of resource assignment and complicating task migration. The
	workload is also highly dynamic, varying over time and most workload
	features, and is driven by many short jobs that demand quick scheduling

  abstract = {The advent of cloud computing promises highly available,
	efficient, and flexible computing services for applications such as web
	search, email, voice over IP, and web search alerts. Our experience at
	Google is that realizing the promises of cloud computing requires an
	extremely scalable backend consisting of many large compute clusters
	that are shared by application tasks with diverse service level
	requirements for throughput, latency, and jitter. These considerations
	impact (a) capacity planning to determine which machine resources must
	grow and by how much and (b) task scheduling to achieve high machine
	utilization and to meet service level objectives.

	Both capacity planning and task scheduling require a good understanding
	of task resource consumption (e.g., CPU and memory usage). This in turn
	demands simple and accurate approaches to workload
	classification-determining how to form groups of tasks (workloads) with
	similar resource demands. One approach to workload classification is to
	make each task its own workload. However, this approach scales poorly
	since tens of thousands of tasks execute daily on Google compute
	clusters. Another approach to workload classification is to view all
	tasks as belonging to a single workload. Unfortunately, applying such a
	coarse-grain workload classification to the diversity of tasks running
	on Google compute clusters results in large variances in predicted
	resource consumptions.

	This paper describes an approach to workload classification and its
	application to the Google Cloud Backend, arguably the largest cloud
	backend on the planet. Our methodology for workload classification
	consists of: (1) identifying the workload dimensions; (2) constructing
	task classes using an off-the-shelf algorithm such as k-means; (3)
	determining the break points for qualitative coordinates within the
	workload dimensions; and (4) merging adjacent task classes to reduce the
	number of workloads. We use the foregoing, especially the notion of
	qualitative coordinates, to glean several insights about the Google
	Cloud Backend: (a) the duration of task executions is bimodal in that
	tasks either have a short duration or a long duration; (b) most tasks
	have short durations; and (c) most resources are consumed by a few tasks
	with long duration that have large demands for CPU and memory.},

	ubiquitous services. Centralized infrastructures such as cloud computing
	systems provide suitable solutions for many applications, but their
	scalability could be limited in some scenarios, such as in the case of
	latency-dependent applications. The volunteer cloud paradigm aims at
	overcoming this limitation by encouraging clients to offer their own
	spare, perhaps unused, computational resources. Volunteer clouds are
	thus complex, large-scale, dynamic systems that demand for self-adaptive
	capabilities to offer effective services, as well as modeling and
	analysis techniques to predict their behavior. In this article, we
	propose a novel holistic approach for volunteer clouds supporting
	collaborative task execution services able to improve the quality of
	service of compute-intensive workloads. We instantiate our approach by
	extending a recently proposed ant colony optimization algorithm for
	distributed task execution with a workload-based partitioning of the
	overlay network of the volunteer cloud. Finally, we evaluate our
	approach using simulation-based statistical analysis techniques on a
	workload benchmark provided by Google. Our results show that the
	proposed approach outperforms some traditional distributed task
	scheduling algorithms in the presence of compute-intensive workloads.}

	capabilities experienced radical changes. Desktops and laptops increased
	their processing resources, exceeding users' demand for large part of
	the day. On the other hand, computational methods are more and more
	frequently adopted by scientific communities, which often experience
	difficulties in obtaining access to the required
	resources. Consequently, data centers for outsourcing use, relying on
	the cloud computing paradigm, are proliferating. Notwithstanding the
	effort to build energy-efficient data centers, their energy footprint is
	still considerable, since cooling a large number of machines situated in
	the same room or container requires a significant amount of power. The
	volunteer cloud, exploiting the users' willingness to share a quote of
	their underused machine resources, can constitute an effective solution
	to have the required computational resources when needed. In this paper,
	we foster the adoption of the volunteer cloud computing as a green
	(i.e., energy efficient) solution even able to outperform existing data
	centers in specific tasks. To manage the complexity of such a large
	scale heterogeneous system, we propose a distributed optimization policy
	to task scheduling with the aim of reducing the overall energy
	consumption executing a given workload. To this end, we consider an
	integer programming problem relying on the Alternating Direction Method
	of Multipliers (ADMM) for its solution. Our approach is compared with a
	centralized one and other non-green targeting solutions. Results show
	that the distributed solution found by the ADMM constitutes a good

	Recent work advocates distributed scheduling to overcome the limitations
	of centralized schedulers for large clusters with many competing
	jobs. Such distributed schedulers are inherently scalable, but may make
	poor scheduling decisions because of limited visibility into the overall
	resource usage in the cluster. In particular, we demonstrate that under
	high load, short jobs can fare poorly with such a distributed scheduler.

	We propose instead a new hybrid centralized/distributed scheduler,
	called Hawk. In Hawk, long jobs are scheduled using a centralized
	scheduler, while short ones are scheduled in a fully distributed
	way. Moreover, a small portion of the cluster is reserved for the use of
	short jobs. In order to compensate for the occasional poor decisions
	made by the distributed scheduler, we propose a novel and efficient
	randomized work-stealing algorithm.

	We evaluate Hawk using a trace-driven simulation and a prototype
	implementation in Spark. In particular, using a Google trace, we show
	that under high load, compared to the purely distributed Sparrow
	scheduler, Hawk improves the 50th and 90th percentile runtimes by 80\%
	and 90\% for short jobs and by 35\% and 10\% for long jobs,
	respectively. Measurements of a prototype implementation using Spark on
	a 100-node cluster confirm the results of the simulation.},

  abstract = {Cloud service providers (CSPs) often overbook their resources
	with user applications despite having to maintain service-level
	agreements with their customers. Overbooking is attractive to CSPs
	because it helps to reduce power consumption in the data center by
	packing more user jobs in less number of resources while improving their
	profits. Overbooking becomes feasible because user applications tend to
	overestimate their resource requirements utilizing only a fraction of
	the allocated resources. Arbitrary resource overbooking ratios, however,
	may be detrimental to soft real-time applications, such as airline
	reservations or Netflix video streaming, which are increasingly hosted
	in the cloud. The changing dynamics of the cloud preclude an offline
	determination of overbooking ratios. To address these concerns, this
	paper presents iOverbook, which uses a machine learning approach to make
	systematic and online determination of overbooking ratios such that the
	quality of service needs of soft real-time systems can be met while
	still benefiting from overbooking. Specifically, iOverbook utilizes
	historic data of tasks and host machines in the cloud to extract their
	resource usage patterns and predict future resource usage along with the
	expected mean performance of host machines. To evaluate our approach, we
	have used a large usage trace made available by Google of one of its
	production data centers. In the context of the traces, our experiments
	show that iOverbook can help CSPs improve their resource utilization by
	an average of 12.5\% and save 32\% power in the data center.},

	This paper develops methodologies for incorporating task placement

	constraints increase average task scheduling delays by a factor of 2 to
	6, which often results in tens of minutes of additional task wait

	tasks with a constraint to the average utilization of the resource. UM
	provides a simple model of the performance impact of constraints in that
	task scheduling delays increase with UM. Last, we describe how to
	synthesize representative task constraints and machine properties, and
	how to incorporate this synthesis into existing performance
	benchmarks. Using synthetic task constraints and machine properties
	generated by our methodology, we accurately reproduce performance
	metrics for benchmarks of Google compute clusters with a discrepancy of
